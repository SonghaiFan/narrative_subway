## Application Routes

- `/` - Home page with redirection based on user role
- `/login` - Authentication page
- `/pure-text` - Text-based narrative visualization
- `/visualization` - Interactive visualization dashboard

## User Roles and Access Control

- **Domain Expert**: Has access to all scenarios and can switch between different visualization modes
- **Normal User**: Automatically directed to their assigned visualization mode

## Key Features

1. **Authentication System**

   - Role-based access control
   - Persistent sessions

2. **Multiple Visualization Approaches**

   - Pure text narrative
   - Interactive graph visualization
   - Hybrid approaches

3. **Interactive Components**

   - Graph visualization with node exploration
   - Tooltips for additional information
   - Resizable panels

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-friendly layouts
   - Adaptive visualization components

## State Management

The application uses a combination of:

- **Zustand** for global state management
- **React Context** for component-specific state
- **Context Providers** for feature-specific state (auth, tooltips, control panel)

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## OpenAI Chat Integration

This project includes an AI assistant powered by OpenAI's API to help analyze narratives.

### Setup

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
3. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key

### Usage

The AI assistant is available in the chat interface and can help with:

- Analyzing narrative events
- Understanding character relationships
- Identifying themes and patterns
- Answering questions about the narrative

The assistant has context about the narrative events and can provide insights based on the selected event.

### Message Limit

There is a limit of 20 messages per session to manage API usage. The remaining message count is displayed in the chat interface.

## Environment Variables

This application requires the following environment variables:

### OpenAI API Key

The application uses OpenAI's API for the AI chat functionality. You need to set up the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

1. For local development:

   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

2. For Vercel deployment:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
   - Add a new environment variable with the name `OPENAI_API_KEY` and your API key as the value
   - Redeploy your application

Without this environment variable, the AI chat functionality will not work.

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed on Vercel. Make sure to set up the required environment variables in your Vercel project settings before deploying.

```bash
npm run dev     # Start development server
npm run build   # Build for production
npm run start   # Start production server
npm run lint    # Run ESLint
```
